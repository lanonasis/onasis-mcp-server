# Progress Update - August 23, 2025

## Current Architecture Status

### MCP Server Deployment ✅
- Remote MCP server successfully deployed and accessible
- Websocket connections configured and tested
- Multiple protocol channels (HTTP, WebSocket, SSE) operational

### Authentication & Authorization Issues ⚠️
**Critical Finding**: Current MCP implementation bypasses Core authentication entirely
- MCP calls database directly without proper JWT validation
- Missing integration with vendor table RLS (Row Level Security) setup
- API key management service exists but not properly linked to vendor compartmentalization

### Service Architecture Analysis
Working across 3 main directories:
1. **onasis-core**: Main authentication and vendor management system
2. **onasis-mcp-standalone**: Remote MCP server (this project)
3. **lanonasis-maas**: Memory as a Service implementation

### Integration Problems Identified
1. **Authentication Bypass**: MCP → DB direct calls skip Core's auth layer
2. **Vendor Isolation**: No RLS enforcement through MCP channels
3. **API Key Management**: Exists but not integrated with vendor tables
4. **Router Redundancy**: Current setup makes MCP router potentially obsolete

### Testing Results
- **Node.js Integration**: ✅ Perfect functionality
- **Claude Desktop**: ✅ Successful connection and basic operations
- **Authentication Flow**: ❌ Bypasses Core security

## Next Steps Required
1. Route all MCP calls through Core's authenticated endpoints
2. Implement proper JWT validation in MCP layer
3. Ensure vendor RLS is enforced on all memory operations
4. Align API key management with vendor compartmentalization
5. Review and potentially refactor MCP routing architecture

## Risk Assessment
**HIGH RISK**: Current setup compromises the entire security model by allowing unauthenticated database access through MCP channels.

## Recommended Immediate Actions
1. Implement MCP → Core endpoint routing instead of direct DB calls
2. Add JWT validation middleware to all MCP operations
3. Test vendor isolation through MCP channels
4. Audit all existing MCP endpoints for security compliance
